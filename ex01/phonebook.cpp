/*
** This function is for buffer overflow handling.
**
** I don't like allowing the user to input an unlimited number of characters to
** my buffer, so I restrict field lengths. I use cin.getline(buff, BUFSIZE) to
** control this. If the user inputs more than BUFSIZE-1 characters for a given
** buffer, getline will extract only up to BUFSIZE-1 characters and ignore the
** rest. The cin.getline function uses a cstring buffer, and cstrings are always
** null-terminated, hence the -1. The BUFSIZE includes the null terminator. The
** rest of the user input will remain in the cin buffer. This function is to
** handle the resulting situation so the cin buffer is cleared and ready for
** new user input.
**
** If getline extracts no characters OR no delimiting character ('\n' by
** default) is found after BUFSIZE-1 characters are read, it will set the fail
** bit of the cin instance (which we can detect by using the cin.fail member
** function). The gcount member function of cin will return the number of
** characters extracted in the last unformatted input operation on the cin
** object (i.e. the getline function, in this case).
**
** Thus, if the fail bit is set AND the gcount is BUFSIZE-1, we know the user
** input was bigger than our buffer and truncated by getline, which means the
** cin buffer needs to be cleared. So first we test for this condition.
**
** If we don't clear the cin buffer, it causes infinite looping. This seems to
** be related to the fail bit. I think that if the fail bit isn't reset, the
** cin.getline function just keeps failing over and over again, causing the
** input loop to loop infinitely.
**
** To prevent this, I use cin.clear member function, which clears the fail bit,
** and then I use cin.ignore up to the streamsize max limit or until the next
** '\n' to ignore everything else accumulated in the cin buffer, so that it
** isn't extracted in subsequent input loops.
**
** Whew. Done!
**
** Then I return 0 or 1 to indicate whether an overflow occurred for further
** optional handling by the calling function, as desired.

** This function handles contact adding, and will be called when the user inputs
** the ADD command. We use the Contact class, which has two string arrays, one
** variable array called input_data and another static const array called
** input_msg, each with five string instances. The data strings are for storing
** user input, and the message strings are for storing user prompts associated
** with each input and stored as literal string constants defined in the
** Contact.class.cpp define file. They are static since they are class-specific
** and not member-specific, so their memory space should be shared by all
** classes, and constants since they should never be changed.
**
** We receive the address of an array of 8 Contact instances as an argument.
**
** We declare a static int i, which is initialized to 0 and used to iterate
** through the different Contact instances in the array. Every time add_contact
** is called, it will increment by 1.
**
** We declare a local int x, which is used to iterate through the different
** string instances in the input_data and input_msg arrays. These arrays
** represent the input fields of a contact and are in the following order:
**
** First name
** Last name
** Nickname
** Phone number
** Darkest secret
**
** So x will move from one field to another within a contact, and i will move
** from one contact to another within the phonebook.
**
** We have a cstring named buff used as a buffer, of size FIELD_BUFF_SIZE.
**
** If we are have gone through all 8 contacts (i == 8), then we want to loop
** back to the oldest contact, which will be the contact at phonebook[0], so we
** reset i to 0 if i is greater than 7.
**
** When we enter the add_contact function, we have a WHILE loop that loops until
** we have reached the fifth data item. 
**
** //THE WHILE LOOP\\
**
** - The bzero function is used to zero the buffer at the start of every loop.
** - Then we display the input message associated with the current field (as
** defined by the x variable).
** - Then we use cin.getline and our buffer to wait for user input and retrieve
** it.
** - The cin.getline method will retrieve only enough characters to fill the
** buffer size passed as an argument (in bytes). If the user inputs more than
** that, cin.getline will fill the buffer up to the limit (FIELD_BUFF_SIZE-1,
** because a cstring must be null terminated) and throw an error.
** - Then we use the cin_buff_overflow function to detect and handle a buffer
** overflow error. We will discard their input, so we will NOT increment x in
** this case, and instead prompt the user again for new input for the field.
** - If cin_buff_overflow detects that the user has overflowed the buffer, we
** will warn them that they need to input fewer characters on the console before
** prompting them for input again.
** - If the input was valid, we will copy the buff string to the corresponding
** input_data instance (as defined by x) within the current contact (as defined
** by i) and then increment x to go to the next field in the contact.
**
** When all five fields have been filled with valid data, we exit the while and
** increment i to go to the next contact and return from the function.
